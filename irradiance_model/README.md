### Quick Start

- I am using [Mamba Package Manager](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
- Should be completely compatible with Conda
- Setup packages with environment.yml
- run script with "python src/main.py"
- play around with different values in eei-tower.toml to simulate different locations / plant needs

### Status

- A lot of unused code since I was playing around a lot
- Simulates lighting (natural + supplemental artificial) part
- Thermodynamic examination will be done in modelica
- For now only calculates values per m2
