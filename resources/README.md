### information on resource usage of vertical farms in comparison to traditional agriculture

- [WEBSITE why vertical farming just doesn't work](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/why-vertical-farming-just-doesnt-work) - pessimistic
- [PAPER life cycle assessment (LCA) of a vertical farm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2023.06.020) - more optimistic

### information on sun's irradiance, photovoltaic and typical meterological year (TMY) data

- [WEBSITE pvlib tutorial](https://pvsc-python-tutorials.github.io/PVSC48-Python-Tutorial/Tutorial%200%20-%20Overview.html)

### information on controlled environment agriculture (CEA), plant care and greenhouse simulation

- [WEBSITE modelica greenhouses library](https://greenhouses-library.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html)
- [WEBSITE lecture serious about indoor farming](https://optimiauniversity.org/)
- [PAPER greenhouse climate model](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2011.06.001)
- [PAPER scoping review of CEA](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2023.103673) - sections 3 & 4 offer a good overview over the field
- [PAPER broad overview of vertical farms](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12010002) - broad with focus on root zone - not only technical aspects - focuses on hydroponics - I plan to use aeroponics
