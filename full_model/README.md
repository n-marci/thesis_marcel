### Quick Start

- These steps are subject to change as I may change from a model to a package as the simulation becomes more complicated
- I am using [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org/#) for my simulation
- Install OpenModelica
- Install the Greenhouses library
  - On the welcome page click on install library
  - **Undo** the checkmarks for "Full" and "Partial"
  - Click on name and choose Greenhouses library
  - Click on OK
- Open up the verticalfarm.mo file from this repository
- Change working directory in the Settings
  - Tools > Options > Working Directory
  - Browse to the location of this folder
- Open up the file from the left sidebar
- Click on Simulate (top bar)
- Hopefully everything works

### Status

- Right now just getting the simulation running
- Results are not meaningful at the moment
