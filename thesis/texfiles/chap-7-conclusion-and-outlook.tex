Shading is not considered in this work to preserve visibility from the building to the outside.
Include CO2 and humidity in simulation.
Smarter lighting system.

Feasibility of aeroponic system with piezoelectric vaporizer in a long term deployment.
Also, the nutrient density of the fog changes due to the vaporization.
Would be interesting to design an experiment mixing specific nutrient solution, then vaporizing, then condensing and analyzing how it changed.
This has not been done before as far as the author can tell.
