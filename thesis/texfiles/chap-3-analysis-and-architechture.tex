\section{Presentation of the General Concept}
Metrics to evalute feasibility of the concept:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The energy consumption can be met through a solar installation covering at most the area on the roof.
	\item Yield can offset investment costs in a reasonable timeframe.
	\item Farm provides measurable insulation increase in comparison with the 'naked' building.
\end{itemize}
